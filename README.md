##### ETL Project - Data Analytics Bootcamp - 14er Hiking and Camping

## Motivation for gathering the data:
Summertime is approaching, which is hiking season here in Colorado. We wanted to have a dataset ready for users to be able to plan their trip into the Rocky Mountains to hike one of the 58 mountain peaks that are 14,000 feet high or higher (called a 14er). We wanted inexperienced or visiting hikers to have a dataset where one stop planning could occur. 
## Specific use cases for the data:
    The use case of the data is to combine datasets, so that any person can go camping and hike a 14er in a Colorado mountain range. There are 58 14ers in Colorado and we wanted       to provide the user with a dataset that will give distance from a campground to a 14er, basic information about the 14er and the most frequently used trails, and trailheads by     which it can be accessed. In addition, we have provided road type to ensure the user has the correct vehicle to access the trail head. 
    We utilized a hard coded 20 mile distance. We felt this was an ideal distance for driving from the campground to the trailhead. If a user interface were developed, the user       could adjust the distance input to determine campsites within various distances, but at this point it is hard coded. 
  # A user will be able to access:
    Campground Name
    Distance from Campsite to Mountain Peak (miles)
    Trailhead
    Road Type
    Mountain Range
     Elevation_ft
    Peak Latitude
    Peak Longitude
    Standard Route
    Standard Route Distance (miles)
    Elevation Gain_ft
    Difficulty
## The sources of data we used to extract was:
    Southwest_camp_data.csv from http://www.uscampgrounds.info/takeit.html  to which we added headers.
      Columns used: Long, Lat, Name
    14ers_data.csv from https://www.kaggle.com/mikeshout/14erpeaks
      Columns used: Mountain Peak, Mountain Range, Lat, Long
    14ers trailhead by road difficulty scraped from https://www.14ers.com/php14ers/trailheads_bydifficulty.php
